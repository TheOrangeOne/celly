The API is pretty straightforward and returns generally sensible data.

Doing a GET between two dates will return the schedule data for each day
between the two dates (inclusive).

The schema is roughly the following:

totalItems: ,
totalEvents: ,
totalGames: ,
totalMatches: ,
wait: ,
dates: [
  # list of schedule
  {
    date: "%Y-%m-%d",
    totalItems: ,
    totalEvents: ,
    totalGames: ,
    totalMatches: ,
    games: [
      # list of game
      {
        gameType: "R",  # regular season?
        season: "20182019",
        gameDate: "2018-10-13T17:00:00Z"
        status: {
          abstractGameState: "Preview",
          codedGameState: "1",
          detailedState: "Scheduled",
          statusCode: "1",
          startTimeTBD: false
        },
        teams: {
          away: {
            leagueRecord: {
              wins: 0,
              losses: 2,
              ot: 0,
              type: "league",
            },
            score: 0,
            team: {
              id: 22,
              name: "Edmonton Oilers",
              link: "/api/v1/teams/22"
            },
          },
          home: {}, # same format as away
       },
       linescore: {
         currentPeriod: 0,
         periods: [ ],
         shootoutInfo: {}, # not relevant (for now)
         teams: {
           home: {
             team: {} # same as team above
             goals: 0,
             shotsOnGoal: 0,
             goaliePulled: false,
             numSkaters: 0,
             powerPlay: false,
           },
           away: {}, # similar as home

The only edge case is when there is a day with _no_ games scheduled, then the
API returns _nothing_ in the "dates" field.
